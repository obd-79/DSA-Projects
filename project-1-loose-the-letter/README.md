# Project 1: Loose the Letter and Table

## Overview
This project simulates a game where N people are sitting around a table, and each person loses a letter from their name based on a randomly chosen number k. The game continues until only one person remains at the table.

## Features
- **Circular Linked List Implementation:** The scenario is modeled using a circular linked list.
- **Random Name Selection:** Names are chosen randomly from a provided text file, with an optional character limit for fairness.
- **Game Simulation:** The program displays the value of k in each turn, the selected student, and the whole list of names, marking the one who just lost a letter.
- **Winner Declaration:** At the end of the game, the program displays the winner.

## Requirements
- **Language:** The implementation language is not specified.
- **Libraries:** String and File (Scanner) library functions can be used.
- **Input File:** A text file containing first names (e.g., `class.txt`) is required for random name selection.

## Problems
### Problem 1: Loose the Letter and Table
- Implement a circular linked list to simulate the game scenario.
- Display the value of k, the selected student, and the whole list of names in each turn.
- Declare the winner at the end of the game.
